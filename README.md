## Version-Control Procedures

Each collaborator should create a new branch with a descriptive name whenever they start working on a new item in the project backlog.

Each collaborator should push the most recent version of each branch to GitHub before each meeting.

A branch should have working code when a pull request is made.

## Tool Stack Description and Setup Procedure

The Django framework is used both to create the server for the website and to manage the database.

React is used to build the frontend of the website.

A sqlite database is used to store data.

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the GitHub repository located at 'https://github.com/logan-nielsen/Frappuccino-Paradise-Group-3'
2. Navigate to the app/ directory
3. Install the project dependencies: ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Ignore changes to secrest.json: ```git update-index --assume-unchanged secrets.json```
5. Generate a django secret key and add it to secrets.json. A key can be easily generated using this website: https://djecrety.ir/
6. Set up the database: ```$ python manage.py migrate```
7. Create an admin account: ```$ python manage.py createsuperuser```
8. Migrate again: ```$ python manage.py migrate```
9. Install node modules: ```$ npm i```
10. Start webpack builds: ```$ npm run dev```
11. In another terminal window, start the development server: ```$ python manage.py runserver```

## Unit Testing Instructions
All unit tests can be automatically run by executing the command ```$ python -Wa manage.py test```

This will automatically run any script in the application whose name starts with 'test'

You can run tests only from a certain package or module by supplying them at the end ```$ python -Wa manage.py test packagename```

In our program most tests should be placed in the tests package found in the FrappuccinoParadise app.

Examples of testing scripts can be found at ```https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/overview/```



## System Testing Instructions

The first step for system testing is to build the project and start a development server using the instructions found under the header "Build Instructions" of this document. Once the development server is running, use a web browser to navigate to the address ```localhost:8000```. 

Customer role can be tested using a test account the credentials Username: customer1 and Password: customer1password or Username: customer2 and Password: customer2password.
